Game name: Teacher Takeover!

In this game, its teachers vs. students
Students can be single or multiplayer. 

Something is not quite right about the teachers. In an attempt to takeover summer vacation, the teachers have gone classwork crazy! They want to give the students a bunch of classwork, quizzes, and projects to do.

The students have to fight back in order to save their summer vacation and freedom! They've been armed with assignment blasters that destroy any attack (assigned work) that the teachers give. (reason with the teacher to lower willpower)

In this game, students will face off between teachers of different subjects (Homeroom, PE, Music, Spanish, Art). They can go to lunch (once per game) to regenerate their energy or they can reason with the teacher to decrease their willpower of assigning more work

----Win or Lose----
To win the game, the student player must defeat all teachers. If the student takes on too much damage, they can take a lunch break to regenerate full health, but they can only go to lunch ONCE in the entire game (think of a typical school day). If they continue to take on too much damage, they can multiply their defense by using the Reasoning attack method to lower their teacher's willpower, thus defeating them quicker
